# Synavate Labs: Orion AI Threat Intelligence Platform
## Vision Summary:
Synavate Labs is developing the "Orion AI Threat Platform/Constellation," a Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform. The repositories currently reflect a blend of creativity and technical aspirations. Below is a concise summary of the concept and goals.

### Thesis: Adversarial AI is rapidly advancing, necessitating innovative defense strategies. Orion aims to be an offensive-defensive tool with four core components, drawing inspiration from the Orion Hunter constellation. This remains a research project with ongoing developments and learnings.

## Orion Constellation Components
###Orion Threat Hunters:

#### Function: Semi-Autonomous Threat Hunters monitor CIDR ranges or known threat actors for heuristics indicative of automated system attacks.
Goal: Understand and identify TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of attackers. Act as a distributed network rather than a host-based system.

## Orion Agents:

#### Function: Multi-agent network processes data from hunters, triages information, and reports findings.
#### Goal: Utilize high-quality signals for training defensive models and identifying new heuristics for detecting attack vectors.

## Cognitive Synthesis:

#### Function: Synthetic data generator trained on a mix of threats and benign traffic.
#### Goal: Develop defensive models capable of withstanding novel attacks across different industries.

## Orion Network:

#### Function: Maintain data encryption in motion and at rest to ensure transaction authenticity.
#### Goal: Implement a blockchain system inspired by Dr. Adam Weigold's research at Cryptic Inc.

#### Challenges and Next Steps
Team: We need YOU!  ðŸ’»
Integrations: Taking  the Proof of Concept elements and integrate them with a streaming data source
Attack Vectors: Defining "zones of the sky" for monitoring and dissecting attack vectors remains a challenge.
Human Involvement: High-quality signals and human involvement are essential for training defensive models.
Ethical Concerns: Balancing the development of powerful systems as both defensive tools and potential weapons.

## Collaboration and Future Work
Synavate Labs is one person at this stage and we want YOU! (All coding made me become a we it appears!) 
We aim to evaluate advanced technology for efficacy in addressing contemporary cybersecurity challenges. If you'd like to join us on this journey, please reach out.

!!!! Everything we do is automation first. We don't want to do anything more than three times. Ultimately the goal is to have 10-50x efficiency gains ourselves, then provide that service. !!!!!
